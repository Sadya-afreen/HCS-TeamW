This repo contains a Client-Server Architectural Program. A remote secure app on the smartphone (client) can lock a remote desktop (Server) using a single button click.

How to run:
An .exe file as well as jar file exists. Either of the file should be run on the desktop/laptop first.
The app installed on the smartphone then should be opened to establish a connection.
Lastly, clicking on the lock button shown on the smartphone screen should lock the desktop remotely.
